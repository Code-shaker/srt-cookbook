# Drift Tracer

## Packet Delivery Time

`PktTsbPdTime = TsbPdTimeBase + TsbPdDelay + PKT_TIMESTAMP + Drift`

## TSBPD Base Time

`TsbPdTimeBase` is the base time difference between local clock of the receiver, and the clock used by the sender to timestamp packets being sent. A unit of measurement is microseconds.

### Initial value

The value of `TsbPdTimeBase`  is initialized at the time of the handshake request \(`HSREQ` \) is received.  
`TsbPdTimeBase = T_NOW - HSREQ_TIMESTAMP`.  
This value should roughly correspond to the one-way delay \(**~RTT/2**\).

### TSBPD Wrapping Period

The value of  `TsbPdTimeBase`  can be updated during the **TSBPD** wrapping period. The period starts **30 seconds before** reaching the maximum timestamp value of a packet \(`CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP`\), and ends whens the timestamp of the received packet is within \[30; 60\] seconds.  
`CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP = 0xFFFFFFFF`, or maximum 32-bit unsigned integer value. The value is in microseconds, which corresponds to 1 hour 11 minutes and 35 seconds \(01:11:35\).  
In other words, TSBPD time wrapping happens every 01:11:35.

During this wrapping period, a packet may have a timestamp close to `CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP`, as well as close to `0`. Both cases are handled. In the first case, the current value of `TsbPdTimeBase` is used. In the seconds case, `TsbPdTimeBase + CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP + 1` is used to calculate TSBPD time of a packet.

The wrapping period ends when the timestamp of the received packet is within the interval \[30; 60\] seconds. The updated value will be `TsbPdTimeBase += CPacket::MAX_TIMESTAMP + 1`.

### Time Drift

The value of  `TsbPdTimeBase`  can be updated by the DriftTracer.

## Time Drift Sample

Upon receipt of an `ACKACK` packet, the timestamp of this control packet is used as a sample for drift tracing. `ACKACK` timestamp is expected to be half the round-trip time ago \(**RTT/2**\). The drift time **DRIFT** is calculated from the current time **T\_NOW**; the TSBPD base time `TsbPdTimeBase`; and the timestamp **ACKACK\_TIMESTAMP** of the received `ACKACK` packet.

`DRIFT = T_NOW - (TsbPdTimeBase + ACKACK_TIMESTAMP)`

The base time should stay in sync with `T_NOW - T_SENDER` , and should roughly correspond to **~RTT/2**. The value of `ACKACK_TIMESTAMP` should represent `T_SENDER`, and be **~RTT/2** in the past.  
Therefore, the above equation can be considered as   
`DRIFT = T_NOW - (T_NOW - T_SENDER + T_SENDER) -> 0` if the link latency remains constant.

Assuming that the link latency is constant \(RTT=const\), the only cause of the drift fluctuations should be clock inaccuracy.

## Drift Tracing and Adjustment

Drift tracing is based on accumulating the sum of drift samples.  
**DriftSum** - the sum of the time drift samples on a **MAX\_SPAN** number of samples.  
**DriftSpan** is the current number of accumulated samples.  
The default value of **MAX\_SPAN** is 1000 samples.  
The default value of **MAX\_DRIFT** is 5000 Î¼s \(5 ms\).  
The default value of **CLEAR\_ON\_UPDATE** is **true**.

On each **DriftSpan** sample, the average drift value **Drift** is updated as  
`Drift = DriftSum / DriftSpan`.  
The values of **DriftSpan** and **DriftSum** are reset to 0.

If the absolute value of the Drift exceeds **MAX\_DRIFT** \(`|Drift| > MAX_DRIFT`\), the remainder goes to **OverDrift** value.  
The value of **OverDrift** is used to update the **TsbPdTimeBase**.

In pseudo-code it looks like this:

```text
bool update(int64_t driftval)
{
	DriftSum += driftval;
	++DriftSpan;

	if (m_uDriftSpan < MAX_SPAN)
		return false;

	if (CLEAR_ON_UPDATE)
		Overdrift = 0;

	Drift     = DriftSum / DriftSpan;
	DriftSum  = 0;
	DriftSpan = 0;

	if (std::abs(Drift) > MAX_DRIFT)
	{
		Overdrift = Drift < 0 ? -MAX_DRIFT : MAX_DRIFT;
		Drift    -= Overdrift;
	}

	// Drift value was updated
	return true;
}
```

**TODO:** Use RTTVar.

## Class DriftTracer

The **DriftTracer** class has the following prototype.

```text
template<unsigned MAX_SPAN, int MAX_DRIFT, bool CLEAR_ON_UPDATE = true>
class DriftTracer
{
public:
    DriftTracer();
public:
    bool update(int64_t driftval);
    int64_t drift() const;
    int64_t overdrift() const;
};
```
